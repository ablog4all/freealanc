Free Alan C Blog

This is my adaptation of a website using HTML CSS and JS.
I created this after participating in a class by Kevin Powell via Scrimba and Front End Mentor.
The main concepts I learn include the following:
HTML syntax and CSS styling
Javascript integration for hiding and changing content
JS tab navigation
Accessability
Responsiveness

The artwork and writing were created by me, to use in combination with the elements of this website in an interesting way.
Thanks and enjoy!
